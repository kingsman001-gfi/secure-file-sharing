# FUTURE_CS_03 🔐 Secure File Sharing System

## 📌 Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Future Interns Cyber Security Internship (Task 3)**. It provides a secure platform for uploading, downloading, and managing files using **AES-256 encryption**, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

## 🔍 About the Task

In this hands-on internship project, I built a secure file sharing system that allows users to upload and download files safely. The core focus was **data protection**, where I implemented AES-256 encryption to safeguard files during both storage and transfer.

This project simulates real-world scenarios where secure data sharing is essential—such as in healthcare, legal, or corporate environments.

## ✅ What I Did

- Developed a Flask-based web portal for file uploads and downloads  
- Implemented AES-256 encryption using PyCryptodome  
- Built a simple HTML/CSS user interface for uploading, downloading, and deleting files  
- Added error handling for invalid decryption attempts  
- Documented the system architecture and security measures  
- Uploaded screenshots and final report to GitHub
